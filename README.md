# Forecasting NOx Atmospheric Concentrations for Pollution and Climate Change

This repository contains code that monitors and forecasts atmospheric NOx concentrations.

## Background

The problem we are addressing is the monitoring and forecasting of atmospheric NOx concentrations, which are primarily caused by anthropogenic activity. Large emitters of NOx include the combustion of fossil fuels for transportation, power generation, and industrial activity. These emissions can be mitigated by reducing activity, switching to alternative clean energy sources, and adapting source emissions capture systems. Not only are NOx concentrations important for pollution studies (e.g. smog), but they also serve as a proxy for the more hard-to-measure CO2 emissions, the primary greenhouse gas responsible for long-term global warming.
We aim to provide reliable forecasts of NOx concentrations, ultimately contributing to improved air quality management and reduced negative impacts on public health and the environment.

## Approach

This project implements a modeling and forecasting system for the spatially-localized levels of atmospheric NOx. To achieve this, we use the Sentinel 5P satellite data available in Google Earth Engine to obtain historical time series data of NOx concentrations over regions of interest.

Using this data, we employ state-space structural time series models to extract trends, seasonal effects and other important covariates using the historical time series data. Our models analyze daily data to identify short-term trends and effects and make predictions.
